Science is the study of the natural world through observation and experimentation. It helps us understand how things work—from the smallest atoms to the vastness of the universe. Scientists use evidence and reasoning to form theories and solve problems that improve our lives.

Science is divided into different branches. Physics explores energy, matter, and forces; chemistry studies substances and how they change; biology focuses on living organisms. Other branches include Earth science, astronomy, and environmental science, each helping us understand different parts of the world around us.

At the heart of science is the scientific method—a step-by-step process that starts with asking a question, forming a hypothesis, testing it through experiments, and analyzing results. This method helps scientists discover reliable facts and avoid guessing or relying on beliefs alone.

Science drives technology. From electricity and medicine to space travel and smartphones, many of the things we use daily came from scientific research. As scientists discover more, engineers and inventors use that knowledge to create new tools and solutions.

Science continues to grow rapidly, especially in fields like artificial intelligence, genetics, and space exploration. Scientists are working on cures for diseases, ways to protect the environment, and even finding life on other planets. The future of science holds exciting possibilities that could change the way we live.
