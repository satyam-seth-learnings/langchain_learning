The earliest known civilizations emerged around river valleys, such as Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China. These societies developed writing, agriculture, trade, and complex governments. Their innovations, like the wheel and early forms of writing like cuneiform and hieroglyphics, laid the foundation for human progress.

The Middle Ages, or medieval period, lasted from roughly the 5th to the late 15th century. It began after the fall of the Roman Empire and was marked by feudalism, the rise of the Catholic Church, and frequent warfare. Despite being labeled the "Dark Ages," this era also saw growth in art, learning, and the foundation of universities.

Starting in the 14th century, the Renaissance was a period of renewed interest in art, science, and classical learning, especially in Europe. Thinkers like Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo made major advances, while artists like Michelangelo and Raphael created works that are still celebrated today. This era helped shape modern Western thought.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Industrial Revolution transformed economies and societies. It began in Britain with the invention of machines that revolutionized production. Urbanization increased, new transportation methods like railroads developed, and labor systems changed dramaticallyâ€”though it also brought pollution and harsh working conditions.

The 20th century was one of the most eventful periods in history. It saw two world wars, the Cold War, the rise and fall of empires, civil rights movements, and the development of technology that connected the world. Events like the moon landing, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the growth of the internet reshaped the modern world.
